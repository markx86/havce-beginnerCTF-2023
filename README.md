# havce-beginnerCTF-2023
This repository contains my solutions to some of the `pwn` and `Reverse Engineering` challanges from havce's [beginnerCTF 2023](https://beginner.havce.it).

## Where are the writeups?
There are none. I'm a lazy fuck. I left some comments in either the challange source code, Ghidra disassembly or my exploits; hopefully they're clear enough. 

## How do I open `.gzf` files?
Those are Ghidra zip files. To open them, start up Ghidra, create a new project, then go to `File > Import File...` and select the `.gzf` file.  
A new window should appear; make sure `Format:` is `GZF Input Format`. Press `OK` and open the imported file in the CodeBrowser.
